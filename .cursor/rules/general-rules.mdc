# Always read this document /documentation/README.md. Don't make any modifications to the README.md when adding new features. Update the "Key Features Implemented" with major features and functionality that we implement along the way.

# Codging guidelines:

## Code documentation
1. Write meaningful comments to document and explain the logic. 
2. Include examples when documenting financial or statistical calculations. 
3. Don't add noise comments that just explain the syntax

## Forms:
1. Use flux ui for pure laravel views and forms. 
2. Use Laravel Filament forms for Filament dashbopards.
3. When submitting the form show the wait-loader animation on the submit button. Disable the form buttons while it is loading. This keeps the UI simple and prevents double clicking. 
4. If form submission fails for any reason, re-enable the form buttons and show any error or validation messages.
5. Create custom Form components inherited from default flux UI componenets. Never use a flux componenet directly. This allows us to customize the flux componenets but updating the custom compnenets on one place.

### Form entry validation
1. When validating phone number format always use Google libphonenumber library.
2. When filling out a form for creating or modifying a OrgUser the following should validate to true:
- full name is unique across the same org.
- phone number is valid and unique across the same org.
- email address is valid and unique across the same org.
3. In multi step forms involving creating more than one OrgUser, all full names, emails, and phone numbers entered must be unique to each other as well as across the org.
4. OrgUser data validations should include soft deleted OrgUser's, but ignore archived OrgUser's. 
5. Consider creating custom validators that could be reused elsewhere.
6. Use client-side validation we well as server-side and any validation errors using meaningful descriptions under each field in the form.
